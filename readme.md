This is a collection of simple templates for LaTeX documents.
*exercise-template* contains a template suited for simple exercises for an assignment for example.<br>
*report-template* is a simple template for short reports. It supports basically the same features as the first one, but has a slightly different layout more suited for report-style exercises.

I am also working on my Bachelor thesis, which I will provide in template form as well. This will support multi-file and per-file rendering, abbreviations and everything else you would want for that kind of project.

I created this to be my template for my own exercises I do at my University.
This software runs under the GNU GPL_v3.

If you have useful ideas how to expand this template in a meaningful way, feel free to hit me up.
I will keep updating this file for my own needs.
