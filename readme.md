This is a simple template for LaTeX documents.

I created this to be my template for my exercises I do at my University.
This software runs under the GNU GPL_v3.

If you have useful ideas how to expand this template in a meaningful way, feel free to hit me up.
I will keep updating this file for my own needs.
